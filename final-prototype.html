		 <p>Kakadu is dual-listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List for its outstanding natural and cultural values.
			The park is a living cultural landscape.</p>
            <p>Its archaeological sites record the skills and way of life of Aboriginal people over tens of thousands of years. Kakadu’s rock art documents Indigenous creation stories and makes up one of the longest historical records of any group of people in the world.</p> <p>Kakadu’s ancient escarpment and stone country spans more than two billion years of geological history. It’s rivers and coastal floodplains are more dynamic environments, shaped by changing sea levels and big floods every tropical summer.</p>

	<div class="columns_2"> 
		<p>Kakadu National Park was declared in stages, starting in the 1970s. It was a time when Australians were becoming more interested in declaring national parks for conservation and in recognising the land interests of Aboriginal people. The name Kakadu was suggested to recognise Gagudju, an Aboriginal language which used to be spoken in the park.<br>
        <br>
        A new stretch of woodland, called Koongarra, was recently added to Kakadu National Park. Koongarra’s key traditional owner, Jeffrey Lee, fought for more than a decade to prevent mining in his ancestral lands. In 2013, he saw his dream realised when Koongarra became part of Kakadu.<br>
        <br>
        Koongarra lies in the shadow of Nourlangie Rock – if you pause at the lookout to marvel at the view, you are looking at Koongarra. On its other side, Koongarra faces Lightning Dreaming, home of Namarrgon or Lightning Man, the creation ancestor responsible for the dramatic electrical storms.

		Kakadu is a living cultural landscape. It has been home to Aboriginal people for more than 65,000 years. Ours is the oldest living culture on earth.Aboriginal people are called Bininj in the north of the park and Mungguy in the south. Some of us live in Kakadu’s towns and others live in more remote parts of the park, but all of us have a deep spiritual connection to our country.<br>
        <br>
		The land and its people have always been linked. Caring for our land and its wildlife is fundamental to our culture. Art, language, ceremonies, kinship and caring for country are all aspects of cultural responsibility that we have passed from one generation to the next, since the Creation time.<br>
        <br>
        Our clans consist of two or more family groups sharing ownership of an area of land. Clan boundaries are passed from one generation to the next, generally through the father. Kakadu has about 19 clan groups.
